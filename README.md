# ofxLeapMotion2

ofxLeapMotion2 is an OpenFrameworks addon for the second version of the LeapMotion SDK supporting skeleton tracking (beta 2.1). It is tested on Mac OSX, and should support Linux and Windows as well.

It is based on [genekogan's original ofxLeapMotion2 addon](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxLeapMotion2).

Fork updates:

- Uses the 2.3.1 version of the Leap Motion lib. (OS X only)
- Adds scripts for switching lib versions.
- Run the `set231headers213.sh` after clone (will create a symbolic link `libs`)
